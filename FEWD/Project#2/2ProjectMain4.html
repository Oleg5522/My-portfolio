                <h2>Dramatic unexpected turn</h2>
                <p>After that, I returned to my homeland and was hired as a CFO at a manufacturing company. 
                    I fulfilled my dream - I bought my own home, I started doing renovations, and when there were a couple of months 
                    left until the end, the war began. As a result of various circumstances, I was forced to leave my homeland and so
                     I ended up back in America.
                    Now my photo hangs on the honor board "Our Pride" in an institution subordinate to the Ministry of Finance of my country 
                    along 
                    with the photo of the Minister of Finance, the Head of the Main state tax inspectorate and the Head of the State 
                    Pension Fund. <br>And now I am in New York, attending <a target="_blank" href="https://cancode.org/courses/?keyword=&matchtype=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw8MG1BhCoARIsAHxSiQnHLAilUxWmjnfb4oNNNF_B_PlW55xC-L8Nn3JrAqACiq7YJsqzaCkaAlYnEALw_wcB">CanCode Web Development course</a> and working at an entry-level job 
                    with the same hourly salary as I once earned for a month working as a courier in my country by the beginning of my professional life.
