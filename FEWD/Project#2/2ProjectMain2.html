                <h2>Adventures in Africa</h2>
                <p>It was a new era in my life. Africa is a different world. It has different laws, different food, different mentality,

                    jobs.
                    I have had about ten life-threatening situations in my life, and the most dangerous of them happened in Africa, where I was

                     these lines..

                    were forced to stop working our plant. After that, I performed a feat, "pulling out" from the  state budget 
                    a VAT refund of almost a billion francs and left Africa, which had become as my second home, I think, forever...
