     Welcome to my personal page! <br>
My name is Oleg. I am an economist by education and the main part of my working life was connected with accounting, taxation, auditing and finance. <br>
I studied quite a lot, I was the best among the students.
I got a red diploma and naively thought that it gave me the green light in my professional life.
I was disappointed when my first interviews let me know that in my country talents are not needed.
I was forced to work as a courier for a long time and only a year later, after I accidentally met my teacher, I was hired as a chief accountant in a publishing center with a salary of 70 dollars a month. When my future director at that time offered me such money,
 my eyes involuntarily turned into <abbr title="the largest coin in my country">a five-kopeck coin</abbr> , because, working as a courier, I earned only 15 dollars a month.<br>
This is how my professional life path began.
