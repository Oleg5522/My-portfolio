    <div class="main">

    <h2 style="font-size: x-large;">Preamble</h2>

    <p class = "one">After an experimental 20-day fast, I became very interested in recipes and preparing my favorite foods. One of them is chocolate.
        I bought the necessary ingredients at the market, mixed and prepared them, then poured the hot mixture into molds and I got 
        chocolate, which was no different from what you can buy in a supermarket, the cost and price of which is much more expensive
         due to <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.kronchocolatier.com/blogs/news/chocolate-making-process-how-your-favorite-treat-is-made" >mass production</a>. When I treated my friends, 
         they sometimes said to me: “I have never tasted more delicious chocolate in my life!”</p>

    <h3 style="font-size: x-large;"> Ingredients</h3>

    <p>There are only three main ingredients:</p>

    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
    <h4 style="font-size: x-large;">Recipe</h4>
    <p>The recipe is quite simple:
        Initially, the recipe for homemade chocolate was as follows: cocoa mass 300 g, cocoa butter 100 g, honey 150-180 g, spices.
         Later, I reduced the main proportions of cocoa mass and cocoa butter to 2:1 due to the fact that I do not like dark chocolate.
        Everything is done in a water bath, stirring, then poured into molds. Then put it in the refrigerator and after 8 hours your chocolate is ready!</p>

        <p class = "one" >I am confident that if you purchase these ingredients where I purchased them and prepare your chocolate products with love and
             inspiration, your family and friends will never buy chocolate at Trader Joe's again, but will line up in an endless line at 
             your kitchen to get the most delicious chocolate in the world. chocolate world!
